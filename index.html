            Hi! My name is Josh Hayden. Online I go by 'BlinkDynamo', often 'Blink' for short.
            I'm obsessed with programming and computers, focussing most of my energy on system
            tools and low-level software. My high-level software projects are often video 
            games or .NET apps.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tech is unavoidably driven by money. I understand the neccessity of this for driving innovation. 
            That being said, all of the software developers I look up to have done what they've done for the core reason
            of solving extremely difficult problems, openly sourced, free of charge. Here are some names that come to mind:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Linus Torvalds - Creator of the Linux kernel.</li>
            <li>Ken Thompson - Creator of B, Co-creator of UNIX and UTF-8 encoding.</li>
            <li>Dennis Ritchie - Creator of C, Co-creator of UNIX.</li>
            <li>Richard Stallman - Founder of the GNU Project and developer of countless GNU softwares (GCC, glibc, GNU Bash, coreutils, Emacs, etc.).</li>
            <li>Ramon Santamaria - Creator of raylib, along with countless educational tools for beginners.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="solo-projects"><a href="#solo-projects">Solo Projects</a></h2>
