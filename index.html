            Hi! My name is Josh Hayden. Online I go by 'BlinkDynamo', often 'Blink' for short.
            I'm obsessed with programming and computers, focussing most of my energy on system
            tools and low-level software. My high-level software projects are often video 
            games or .NET apps.

        <p>
            Tech is often driven by money somewhere along the way. I understand the neccessity of 
            this for cultivating innovation and new ideas. That being said, all of the greats in 
            software development that I look up to have done what they've done for the core reason
            of solving extremely difficult problems for the everyday programmer years later, free
            of charge. Here are some names that come to mind:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Linus Torvalds - Creator of the Linux kernel.</li>
            <li>Ken Thompson - Creator of B, Co-creator of UNIX and UTF-8 encoding.</li>
            <li>Dennis Ritchie - Creator of C, Co-creator of UNIX.</li>
            <li>Richard Stallman - Founder of the GNU Project and developer of countless GNU softwares (GCC, glibc, GNU Bash, coreutils, Emacs, etc.).</li>
            <li>Ramon Santamaria - Creator of raylib, along with countless educational tools for beginners.</li>
        </ul>
